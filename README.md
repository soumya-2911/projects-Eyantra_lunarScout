# projects-Eyantra_lunarScout
 Our project is a self-balancing remote control bike designed for the Eyantra Lunar Scout competition. It incorporates advanced balancing algorithms and precise control mechanisms for lunar exploration challenges.
# This repo contains the mathematical models and simulations done by us in octave(a similar software as that of matlab) and coppeliasim. We are currently working on the hardware part
